# Testing Strategy for DynamDocumentation Backend

This document outlines the testing strategy for the DynamDocumentation backend.

## Safety First: Test Database Isolation

All tests use an in-memory SQLite database that:
- Is created fresh for each test
- Is completely isolated from your production database
- Is destroyed after each test completes
- Never touches your real data

## Test Structure

The tests are organized in the following structure:

```
/src/test/kotlin/com/dynam/
├── TestSetup.kt         # Base test setup with database isolation
├── TestUtils.kt         # Utility functions for testing
├── repositories/        # Tests for repository classes
├── routes/              # Tests for API routes
└── utils/               # Tests for utility classes
```

## Types of Tests

### 1. Repository Tests

Repository tests verify that:
- Data can be created, read, updated, and deleted correctly
- Queries return the expected results
- Edge cases are handled properly

Example: `UserRepositoryTest.kt`

### 2. Route Tests

Route tests verify that:
- API endpoints return the correct HTTP status codes
- Response bodies contain the expected data
- Authentication and authorization work correctly
- Error handling works as expected

Example: `UserRoutesTest.kt`

### 3. Utility Tests

Utility tests verify that:
- Helper functions work correctly
- Data transformations produce the expected results
- Edge cases are handled properly

Example: `JsonParserTest.kt`

## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

To run a specific test:

```bash
./gradlew test --tests "com.dynam.repositories.UserRepositoryTest"
```

## Test Coverage

As tests are added, aim for:
- At least 80% code coverage
- Tests for all public methods
- Tests for all error conditions

## Writing New Tests

When writing new tests:

1. Extend `DatabaseTest` for tests that need database access
2. Use `dbTestQuery` for database operations in tests
3. Set up test data in the `@BeforeTest` method or within each test
4. Clean up after tests in the `@AfterTest` method (automatic with `DatabaseTest`)
5. Test both success and failure cases

## Best Practices

- Keep tests independent - don't rely on the state from other tests
- Use descriptive test names that explain what's being tested
- Test edge cases and error conditions, not just the happy path
- Use assertions to verify results, don't just check that no exception is thrown
- Clean up any resources created during tests
