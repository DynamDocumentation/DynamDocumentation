I.e. call this before xla_bridge or xla_client\nis imported.**\nSafe to call in non-Cloud TPU environments.\nSome of these environment variables are used to tell the TPU runtime what kind\nof mesh topology to use. It assumes a single-host topology by default, so we\nmanually set them here to default to the full pod slice if applicable.\nThis will not set any env vars if a single topology-related env var is already\nset.",
