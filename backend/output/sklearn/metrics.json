It accounts for the fact that\n    the MI is generally higher for two clusterings with a larger number of\n    clusters, regardless of whether there is actually more information shared.\n    For two clusterings :math:`U` and :math:`V`, the AMI is given as::\n\n        AMI(U, V) = [MI(U, V) - E(MI(U, V))] / [avg(H(U), H(V)) - E(MI(U, V))]\n\n    This metric is independent of the absolute values of the labels:\n    a permutation of the class or cluster label values won't change the\n    score value in any way.\n\n    This metric is furthermore symmetric: switching :math:`U` (``label_true``)\n    with :math:`V` (``labels_pred``) will return the same score value. This can\n    be useful to measure the agreement of two independent label assignments\n    strategies on the same dataset when the real ground truth is not known.\n\n    Be mindful that this function is an order of magnitude slower than other\n    metrics, such as the Adjusted Rand Index.\n\n    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <mutual_info_score>`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    labels_true : int array-like of shape (n_samples,)\n        A clustering of the data into disjoint subsets, called :math:`U` in\n        the above formula.\n\n    labels_pred : int array-like of shape (n_samples,)\n        A clustering of the data into disjoint subsets, called :math:`V` in\n        the above formula.\n\n    average_method : {'min', 'geometric', 'arithmetic', 'max'}, default='arithmetic'\n        How to compute the normalizer in the denominator.\n\n        .. versionadded:: 0.20\n\n        .. versionchanged:: 0.22\n           The default value of ``average_method`` changed from 'max' to\n           'arithmetic'.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    ami: float (upperlimited by 1.0)\n       The AMI returns a value of 1 when the two partitions are identical\n       (ie perfectly matched).

        "description": "Compute the Brier score loss.\n\n    The smaller the Brier score loss, the better, hence the naming with \"loss\".\n    The Brier score measures the mean squared difference between the predicted\n    probability and the actual outcome. The Brier score always\n    takes on a value between zero and one, since this is the largest\n    possible difference between a predicted probability (which must be\n    between zero and one) and the actual outcome (which can take on values\n    of only 0 and 1). It can be decomposed as the sum of refinement loss and\n    calibration loss.\n\n    The Brier score is appropriate for binary and categorical outcomes that\n    can be structured as true or false, but is inappropriate for ordinal\n    variables which can take on three or more values (this is because the\n    Brier score assumes that all possible outcomes are equivalently\n    \"distant\" from one another). Which label is considered to be the positive\n    label is controlled via the parameter `pos_label`, which defaults to\n    the greater label unless `y_true` is all 0 or all -1, in which case\n    `pos_label` defaults to 1.\n\n    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <brier_score_loss>`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    y_true : array-like of shape (n_samples,)\n        True targets.\n\n    y_proba : array-like of shape (n_samples,)\n        Probabilities of the positive class.\n\n    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None\n        Sample weights.\n\n    pos_label : int, float, bool or str, default=None\n        Label of the positive class. `pos_label` will be inferred in the\n        following manner:\n\n        * if `y_true` in {-1, 1} or {0, 1}, `pos_label` defaults to 1;\n        * else if `y_true` contains string, an error will be raised and\n          `pos_label` should be explicitly specified;\n        * otherwise, `pos_label` defaults to the greater label,\n          i.e. `np.unique(y_true)[-1]`.\n\n    y_prob : array-like of shape (n_samples,)\n        Probabilities of the positive class.\n\n        .. deprecated:: 1.5\n            `y_prob` is deprecated and will be removed in 1.7.

        "description": "Compute binary classification positive and negative likelihood ratios.\n\n    The positive likelihood ratio is `LR+ = sensitivity / (1 - specificity)`\n    where the sensitivity or recall is the ratio `tp / (tp + fn)` and the\n    specificity is `tn / (tn + fp)`. The negative likelihood ratio is `LR- = (1\n    - sensitivity) / specificity`. Here `tp` is the number of true positives,\n    `fp` the number of false positives, `tn` is the number of true negatives and\n    `fn` the number of false negatives. Both class likelihood ratios can be used\n    to obtain post-test probabilities given a pre-test probability.\n\n    `LR+` ranges from 1 to infinity. A `LR+` of 1 indicates that the probability\n    of predicting the positive class is the same for samples belonging to either\n    class; therefore, the test is useless. The greater `LR+` is, the more a\n    positive prediction is likely to be a true positive when compared with the\n    pre-test probability. A value of `LR+` lower than 1 is invalid as it would\n    indicate that the odds of a sample being a true positive decrease with\n    respect to the pre-test odds.\n\n    `LR-` ranges from 0 to 1. The closer it is to 0, the lower the probability\n    of a given sample to be a false negative. A `LR-` of 1 means the test is\n    useless because the odds of having the condition did not change after the\n    test. A value of `LR-` greater than 1 invalidates the classifier as it\n    indicates an increase in the odds of a sample belonging to the positive\n    class after being classified as negative. This is the case when the\n    classifier systematically predicts the opposite of the true label.\n\n    A typical application in medicine is to identify the positive/negative class\n    to the presence/absence of a disease, respectively; the classifier being a\n    diagnostic test; the pre-test probability of an individual having the\n    disease can be the prevalence of such disease (proportion of a particular\n    population found to be affected by a medical condition); and the post-test\n    probabilities would be the probability that the condition is truly present\n    given a positive test result.\n\n    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <class_likelihood_ratios>`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    y_true : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix\n        Ground truth (correct) target values.\n\n    y_pred : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix\n        Estimated targets as returned by a classifier.\n\n    labels : array-like, default=None\n        List of labels to index the matrix.

        "description": "Compute the F-beta score.\n\n    The F-beta score is the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall,\n    reaching its optimal value at 1 and its worst value at 0.\n\n    The `beta` parameter represents the ratio of recall importance to\n    precision importance. `beta > 1` gives more weight to recall, while\n    `beta < 1` favors precision. For example, `beta = 2` makes recall twice\n    as important as precision, while `beta = 0.5` does the opposite.\n    Asymptotically, `beta -> +inf` considers only recall, and `beta -> 0`\n    only precision.\n\n    The formula for F-beta score is:\n\n    .. math::\n\n       F_\\beta = \\frac{(1 + \\beta^2) \\text{tp}}\n                        {(1 + \\beta^2) \\text{tp} + \\text{fp} + \\beta^2 \\text{fn}}\n\n    Where :math:`\\text{tp}` is the number of true positives, :math:`\\text{fp}` is the\n    number of false positives, and :math:`\\text{fn}` is the number of false negatives.\n\n    Support beyond term:`binary` targets is achieved by treating :term:`multiclass`\n    and :term:`multilabel` data as a collection of binary problems, one for each\n    label. For the :term:`binary` case, setting `average='binary'` will return\n    F-beta score for `pos_label`.

        "description": "Average hinge loss (non-regularized).\n\n    In binary class case, assuming labels in y_true are encoded with +1 and -1,\n    when a prediction mistake is made, ``margin = y_true * pred_decision`` is\n    always negative (since the signs disagree), implying ``1 - margin`` is\n    always greater than 1.  The cumulated hinge loss is therefore an upper\n    bound of the number of mistakes made by the classifier.\n\n    In multiclass case, the function expects that either all the labels are\n    included in y_true or an optional labels argument is provided which\n    contains all the labels. The multilabel margin is calculated according\n    to Crammer-Singer's method. As in the binary case, the cumulated hinge loss\n    is an upper bound of the number of mistakes made by the classifier.\n\n    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <hinge_loss>`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    y_true : array-like of shape (n_samples,)\n        True target, consisting of integers of two values.

        "description": "Jaccard similarity coefficient score.\n\n    The Jaccard index [1], or Jaccard similarity coefficient, defined as\n    the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of two label\n    sets, is used to compare set of predicted labels for a sample to the\n    corresponding set of labels in ``y_true``.\n\n    Support beyond term:`binary` targets is achieved by treating :term:`multiclass`\n    and :term:`multilabel` data as a collection of binary problems, one for each\n    label. For the :term:`binary` case, setting `average='binary'` will return the\n    Jaccard similarity coefficient for `pos_label`. If `average` is not `'binary'`,\n    `pos_label` is ignored and scores for both classes are computed, then averaged or\n    both returned (when `average=None`). Similarly, for :term:`multiclass` and\n    :term:`multilabel` targets, scores for all `labels` are either returned or\n    averaged depending on the `average` parameter. Use `labels` specify the set of\n    labels to calculate the score for.\n\n    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <jaccard_similarity_score>`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    y_true : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix\n        Ground truth (correct) labels.\n\n    y_pred : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix\n        Predicted labels, as returned by a classifier.\n\n    labels : array-like of shape (n_classes,), default=None\n        The set of labels to include when `average != 'binary'`, and their\n        order if `average is None`. Labels present in the data can be\n        excluded, for example in multiclass classification to exclude a \"negative\n        class\". Labels not present in the data can be included and will be\n        \"assigned\" 0 samples. For multilabel targets, labels are column indices.\n        By default, all labels in `y_true` and `y_pred` are used in sorted order.\n\n    pos_label : int, float, bool or str, default=1\n        The class to report if `average='binary'` and the data is binary,\n        otherwise this parameter is ignored.\n        For multiclass or multilabel targets, set `labels=[pos_label]` and\n        `average != 'binary'` to report metrics for one label only.\n\n    average : {'micro', 'macro', 'samples', 'weighted',             'binary'} or None, default='binary'\n        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned.

This\n            alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance.\n        ``'samples'``:\n            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only\n            meaningful for multilabel classification).\n\n    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None\n        Sample weights.\n\n    zero_division : \"warn\", {0.0, 1.0}, default=\"warn\"\n        Sets the value to return when there is a zero division, i.e. when there\n        there are no negative values in predictions and labels.

The MCC is in essence a correlation coefficient value\n    between -1 and +1. A coefficient of +1 represents a perfect prediction, 0\n    an average random prediction and -1 an inverse prediction.  The statistic\n    is also known as the phi coefficient. [source: Wikipedia]\n\n    Binary and multiclass labels are supported.

These metrics support sparse matrix\n      inputs.\n      ['nan_euclidean'] but it does not yet support sparse matrices.\n\n    - From scipy.spatial.distance: ['braycurtis', 'canberra', 'chebyshev',\n      'correlation', 'dice', 'hamming', 'jaccard', 'kulsinski', 'mahalanobis',\n      'minkowski', 'rogerstanimoto', 'russellrao', 'seuclidean',\n      'sokalmichener', 'sokalsneath', 'sqeuclidean', 'yule']\n      See the documentation for scipy.spatial.distance for details on these\n      metrics. These metrics do not support sparse matrix inputs.\n\n    .. note::\n        `'kulsinski'` is deprecated from SciPy 1.9 and will be removed in SciPy 1.11.\n\n    .. note::\n        `'matching'` has been removed in SciPy 1.9 (use `'hamming'` instead).\n\n    Note that in the case of 'cityblock', 'cosine' and 'euclidean' (which are\n    valid scipy.spatial.distance metrics), the scikit-learn implementation\n    will be used, which is faster and has support for sparse matrices (except\n    for 'cityblock').

The callable\n        should take two arrays from X as input and return a value indicating\n        the distance between them.\n\n    n_jobs : int, default=None\n        The number of jobs to use for the computation.

The precision is\n    intuitively the ability of the classifier not to label a negative sample as\n    positive.\n\n    The recall is the ratio ``tp / (tp + fn)`` where ``tp`` is the number of\n    true positives and ``fn`` the number of false negatives. The recall is\n    intuitively the ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples.\n\n    The F-beta score can be interpreted as a weighted harmonic mean of\n    the precision and recall, where an F-beta score reaches its best\n    value at 1 and worst score at 0.\n\n    The F-beta score weights recall more than precision by a factor of\n    ``beta``. ``beta == 1.0`` means recall and precision are equally important.\n\n    The support is the number of occurrences of each class in ``y_true``.\n\n    Support beyond term:`binary` targets is achieved by treating :term:`multiclass`\n    and :term:`multilabel` data as a collection of binary problems, one for each\n    label. For the :term:`binary` case, setting `average='binary'` will return\n    metrics for `pos_label`. If `average` is not `'binary'`, `pos_label` is ignored\n    and metrics for both classes are computed, then averaged or both returned (when\n    `average=None`). Similarly, for :term:`multiclass` and :term:`multilabel` targets,\n    metrics for all `labels` are either returned or averaged depending on the `average`\n    parameter. Use `labels` specify the set of labels to calculate metrics for.\n\n    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <precision_recall_f_measure_metrics>`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    y_true : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix\n        Ground truth (correct) target values.\n\n    y_pred : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix\n        Estimated targets as returned by a classifier.\n\n    beta : float, default=1.0\n        The strength of recall versus precision in the F-score.\n\n    labels : array-like, default=None\n        The set of labels to include when `average != 'binary'`, and their\n        order if `average is None`.

For the :term:`binary` case, setting `average='binary'` will return\n    precision for `pos_label`. If `average` is not `'binary'`, `pos_label` is ignored\n    and precision for both classes are computed, then averaged or both returned (when\n    `average=None`). Similarly, for :term:`multiclass` and :term:`multilabel` targets,\n    precision for all `labels` are either returned or averaged depending on the\n    `average` parameter.

To prevent such non-finite numbers to pollute\n    higher-level experiments such as a grid search cross-validation, by default\n    these cases are replaced with 1.0 (perfect predictions) or 0.0 (imperfect\n    predictions) respectively.
