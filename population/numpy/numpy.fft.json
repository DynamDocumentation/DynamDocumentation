When both the function and its Fourier transform are\nreplaced with discretized counterparts, it is called the discrete Fourier\ntransform (DFT).  The DFT has become a mainstay of numerical computing in\npart because of a very fast algorithm for computing it, called the Fast\nFourier Transform (FFT), which was known to Gauss (1805) and was brought\nto light in its current form by Cooley and Tukey [CT]_.  Press et al. [NR]_\nprovide an accessible introduction to Fourier analysis and its\napplications.\n\nBecause the discrete Fourier transform separates its input into\ncomponents that contribute at discrete frequencies, it has a great number\nof applications in digital signal processing, e.g., for filtering, and in\nthis context the discretized input to the transform is customarily\nreferred to as a *signal*, which exists in the *time domain*.  The output\nis called a *spectrum* or *transform* and exists in the *frequency\ndomain*.\n\nImplementation details\n----------------------\n\nThere are many ways to define the DFT, varying in the sign of the\nexponent, normalization, etc.  In this implementation, the DFT is defined\nas\n\n.. math::\n   A_k =  \\sum_{m=0}^{n-1} a_m \\exp\\left\\{-2\\pi i{mk \\over n}\\right\\}\n   \\qquad k = 0,\\ldots,n-1.\n\nThe DFT is in general defined for complex inputs and outputs, and a\nsingle-frequency component at linear frequency :math:`f` is\nrepresented by a complex exponential\n:math:`a_m = \\exp\\{2\\pi i\\,f m\\Delta t\\}`, where :math:`\\Delta t`\nis the sampling interval.\n\nThe values in the result follow so-called \"standard\" order: If ``A =\nfft(a, n)``, then ``A[0]`` contains the zero-frequency term (the sum of\nthe signal), which is always purely real for real inputs. Then ``A[1:n/2]``\ncontains the positive-frequency terms, and ``A[n/2+1:]`` contains the\nnegative-frequency terms, in order of decreasingly negative frequency.\nFor an even number of input points, ``A[n/2]`` represents both positive and\nnegative Nyquist frequency, and is also purely real for real input.  For\nan odd number of input points, ``A[(n-1)/2]`` contains the largest positive\nfrequency, while ``A[(n+1)/2]`` contains the largest negative frequency.\nThe routine ``np.fft.fftfreq(n)`` returns an array giving the frequencies\nof corresponding elements in the output.  The routine\n``np.fft.fftshift(A)`` shifts transforms and their frequencies to put the\nzero-frequency components in the middle, and ``np.fft.ifftshift(A)`` undoes\nthat shift.\n\nWhen the input `a` is a time-domain signal and ``A = fft(a)``, ``np.abs(A)``\nis its amplitude spectrum and ``np.abs(A)**2`` is its power spectrum.\nThe phase spectrum is obtained by ``np.angle(A)``.\n\nThe inverse DFT is defined as\n\n.. math::\n   a_m = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}A_k\\exp\\left\\{2\\pi i{mk\\over n}\\right\\}\n   \\qquad m = 0,\\ldots,n-1.\n\nIt differs from the forward transform by the sign of the exponential\nargument and the default normalization by :math:`1/n`.\n\nType Promotion\n--------------\n\n`numpy.fft` promotes ``float32`` and ``complex64`` arrays to ``float64`` and\n``complex128`` arrays respectively. For an FFT implementation that does not\npromote input arrays, see `scipy.fftpack`.\n\nNormalization\n-------------\n\nThe argument ``norm`` indicates which direction of the pair of direct/inverse\ntransforms is scaled and with what normalization factor.\nThe default normalization (``\"backward\"``) has the direct (forward) transforms\nunscaled and the inverse (backward) transforms scaled by :math:`1/n`. It is\npossible to obtain unitary transforms by setting the keyword argument ``norm``\nto ``\"ortho\"`` so that both direct and inverse transforms are scaled by\n:math:`1/\\sqrt{n}`. Finally, setting the keyword argument ``norm`` to\n``\"forward\"`` has the direct transforms scaled by :math:`1/n` and the inverse\ntransforms unscaled (i.e. exactly opposite to the default ``\"backward\"``).\n`None` is an alias of the default option ``\"backward\"`` for backward\ncompatibility.\n\nReal and Hermitian transforms\n-----------------------------\n\nWhen the input is purely real, its transform is Hermitian, i.e., the\ncomponent at frequency :math:`f_k` is the complex conjugate of the\ncomponent at frequency :math:`-f_k`, which means that for real\ninputs there is no information in the negative frequency components that\nis not already available from the positive frequency components.\nThe family of `rfft` functions is\ndesigned to operate on real inputs, and exploits this symmetry by\ncomputing only the positive frequency components, up to and including the\nNyquist frequency.  Thus, ``n`` input points produce ``n/2+1`` complex\noutput points.  The inverses of this family assumes the same symmetry of\nits input, and for an output of ``n`` points uses ``n/2+1`` input points.\n\nCorrespondingly, when the spectrum is purely real, the signal is\nHermitian.  The `hfft` family of functions exploits this symmetry by\nusing ``n/2+1`` complex points in the input (time) domain for ``n`` real\npoints in the frequency domain.\n\nIn higher dimensions, FFTs are used, e.g., for image analysis and\nfiltering.  The computational efficiency of the FFT means that it can\nalso be a faster way to compute large convolutions, using the property\nthat a convolution in the time domain is equivalent to a point-by-point\nmultiplication in the frequency domain.\n\nHigher dimensions\n-----------------\n\nIn two dimensions, the DFT is defined as\n\n.. math::\n   A_{kl} =  \\sum_{m=0}^{M-1} \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\n   a_{mn}\\exp\\left\\{-2\\pi i \\left({mk\\over M}+{nl\\over N}\\right)\\right\\}\n   \\qquad k = 0, \\ldots, M-1;\\quad l = 0, \\ldots, N-1,\n\nwhich extends in the obvious way to higher dimensions, and the inverses\nin higher dimensions also extend in the same way.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n..
