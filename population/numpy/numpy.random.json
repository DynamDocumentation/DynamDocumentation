These are not\ndirectly consumable in Python and must be consumed by a ``Generator``\nor similar object that supports low-level access.\n\n**State and Seeding**\n\nThe ``SFC64`` state vector consists of 4 unsigned 64-bit values. The last\nis a 64-bit counter that increments by 1 each iteration.\n\nThe input seed is processed by `SeedSequence` to generate the first\n3 values, then the ``SFC64`` algorithm is iterated a small number of times\nto mix.\n\n**Compatibility Guarantee**\n\n``SFC64`` makes a guarantee that a fixed seed will always produce the same\nrandom integer stream.\n\nReferences\n----------\n..

This\nallows the original sequence to be split so that distinct segments can be\nused in each worker process.

        "notes": "Philox is a 64-bit PRNG that uses a counter-based design based on weaker\n(and faster) versions of cryptographic functions [1]_. Instances using\ndifferent values of the key produce independent sequences.  Philox has a\nperiod of :math:`2^{256} - 1` and supports arbitrary advancing and jumping\nthe sequence in increments of :math:`2^{128}`. These features allow\nmultiple non-overlapping sequences to be generated.\n\n``Philox`` provides a capsule containing function pointers that produce\ndoubles, and unsigned 32 and 64- bit integers. These are not\ndirectly consumable in Python and must be consumed by a ``Generator``\nor similar object that supports low-level access.\n\n**State and Seeding**\n\nThe ``Philox`` state vector consists of a 256-bit value encoded as\na 4-element uint64 array and a 128-bit value encoded as a 2-element uint64\narray. The former is a counter which is incremented by 1 for every 4 64-bit\nrandoms produced. The second is a key which determined the sequence\nproduced. Using different keys produces independent sequences.\n\nThe input ``seed`` is processed by `SeedSequence` to generate the key. The\ncounter is set to 0.\n\nAlternately, one can omit the ``seed`` parameter and set the ``key`` and\n``counter`` directly.\n\n**Parallel Features**\n\nThe preferred way to use a BitGenerator in parallel applications is to use\nthe `SeedSequence.spawn` method to obtain entropy values, and to use these\nto generate new BitGenerators:\n\n>>> from numpy.random import Generator, Philox, SeedSequence\n>>> sg = SeedSequence(1234)\n>>> rg = [Generator(Philox(s)) for s in sg.spawn(10)]\n\n``Philox`` can be used in parallel applications by calling the ``jumped``\nmethod  to advances the state as-if :math:`2^{128}` random numbers have\nbeen generated. Alternatively, ``advance`` can be used to advance the\ncounter for any positive step in [0, 2**256). When using ``jumped``, all\ngenerators should be chained to ensure that the segments come from the same\nsequence.\n\n>>> from numpy.random import Generator, Philox\n>>> bit_generator = Philox(1234)\n>>> rg = []\n>>> for _ in range(10):\n...    rg.append(Generator(bit_generator))\n...    bit_generator = bit_generator.jumped()\n\nAlternatively, ``Philox`` can be used in parallel applications by using\na sequence of distinct keys where each instance uses different key.\n\n>>> key = 2**96 + 2**33 + 2**17 + 2**9\n>>> rg = [Generator(Philox(key=key+i)) for i in range(10)]\n\n**Compatibility Guarantee**\n\n``Philox`` makes a guarantee that a fixed ``seed`` will always produce\nthe same random integer stream.",

It is also used for modeling maximum wind speed and\nrainfall rates.  It is a \"fat-tailed\" distribution - the probability of\nan event in the tail of the distribution is larger than if one used a\nGaussian, hence the surprisingly frequent occurrence of 100-year\nfloods. Floods were initially modeled as a Gaussian process, which\nunderestimated the frequency of extreme events.\n\nIt is one of a class of extreme value distributions, the Generalized\nExtreme Value (GEV) distributions, which also includes the Weibull and\nFrechet.\n\nThe function has a mean of :math:`\\mu + 0.57721\\beta` and a variance\nof :math:`\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\beta^2`.\n\nReferences\n----------\n..
